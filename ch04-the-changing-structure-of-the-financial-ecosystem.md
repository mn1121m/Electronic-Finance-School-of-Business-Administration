# CHO4. The Changing Structure of the Financial Ecosystem

---


### Incumbent Collaboration with Techfins

**Haven**

- a joint venture announced by Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway
- It aimed to improve how people gain access to health care, starting with their own work forces
    - primary care easier to access
    - insurance benefits simpler to understand and easier to use
    
    - prescription drugs more affordable

***Why Haven is ended 3 years after launching(2021) ?**

- Berkshire Hathaway had a wide variety of systems for administering
health care at the companies it owns.
- JPMorgan funds own health care plan for its employees, which posed a challenge to applying ideas working for Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway. (아이디어를 적용하는 것에 어려움을 겪었다)

### Fintech Collaboration with Techfins

- Fintech - The ability to acquire customers and achieve distributional scale is a critical barrier to their success.
- Technology firms - Their massive customer bases and deep pockets place them in a unique position as a platform for the distribution of fintechs’ financial products.

 ***  fintech가 techfin과 콜라보를 하게 되면 어떠한 요인에서 하게 되는가**

- Fintech는 충분한 고객확보와 자본의 규모가 적은 반면에 Techfin은 대량의 고객층과 충분한 자본이 있기 때문에, fintech의 기술들을 접목시키면 서루 윈윈일 것이다.
